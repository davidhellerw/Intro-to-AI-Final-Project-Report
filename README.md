# Intro-to-AI-Final-Project-Report
Introduction to AI Class Final Group Project Report (as part of my master's degree)

This project delves into the pervasive issue of employee turnover, a phenomenon with significant repercussions for organizations, employees, and the broader economy. With staggering statistics revealing the substantial financial toll of turnover, our study aims to extract insights from a dataset of a large US-based company, illuminating the factors influencing an employee's decision to leave. Beyond statistical exploration, our dual-fold objective encompasses recommending strategies to diminish the turnover rate and leveraging machine learning algorithms for predictive talent retention. The analysis underscores three critical factors—bonus, promotion, and satisfaction—that influence employee decisions. Recommendations for bonus structures advocate for meritbased programs, transparent communication, and variable components. In terms of promotions, fostering professional development, mentorship initiatives, and regular assessments are emphasized. For enhanced satisfaction, suggestions encompass flexible work arrangements, wellness programs, and recognition initiatives. On the predictive front, Random Forest emerges as the model of choice, showcasing superior performance metrics compared to Support Vector Machine. This predictive model equips the company with a tool to anticipate turnover risks and intervene proactively. In conclusion, our project offers actionable insights and recommendations for organizational strategies, combining statistical scrutiny and machine learning prowess to address the intricate landscape of employee turnover for the analyzed company.
